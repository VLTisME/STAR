"""Split-local retrieval evaluation: encode queries + gallery, score, report mAP/MRR/R@K.

Queries and gallery entries are decoupled through ``image_id``:
  - the gallery is every UNIQUE image_id in the eval set (so the data team can add distractor rows,
    i.e. rows that carry an image but no caption -> gallery-only, never a query);
  - each query's ground truth is the gallery position of ITS OWN image_id.

`assemble_query_gallery` is the pure, unit-tested core; `evaluate_retrieval` just feeds it encoded
features. This bi-encoder evaluation is used for dev checkpoint selection; cross-encoder
reranking and assignment consume frozen candidate scores separately.
